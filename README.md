I found this project on the DevChallenges website at the link: https://legacy.devchallenges.io/challenges/UgCqszKR7Q7oqb4kRfI0 to test and improve my knowledge.
The project consists of a group chat application that can be used by companies for their remote communication, where the user can create new rooms or join an existing one.
Registration is required to use the app.
In this project, Express, MongoDB Atlas, and socket.io were used in the backend.
On the frontend, React, Redux, styled-components, contexts, customHooks, and react-router-dom were used.

To start the backend, navigate to the "backend" folder and use the command

 - yarn dev

or

 - npm run dev.

To start the frontend, go to the "chat-group" folder and use the command

 - yarn dev

or

 - npm run dev.
